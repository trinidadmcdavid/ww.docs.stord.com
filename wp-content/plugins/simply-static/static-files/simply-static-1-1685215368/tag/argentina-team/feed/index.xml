<p>Lionel Messi&#8217;s first two matches in Argentina&#8217;s three-star jersey must not have been forgotten! Not to forget. As the people of Argentina saluted their World Cup winning team, Messi was the one; Hard to forget for any Argentina fan either.</p>



<p>After winning the World Cup in Qatar in December last year, Argentina played two friendlies against Panama and Curacao in March this year, which became the stage for the festival. In June, Argentina will play again in a friendly match. Albiceleste will play two matches in Asia tour. Australia will face Messi&#8217;s opponents in Beijing, China on June 15, and the host Indonesia will face them in Jakarta on June 19.</p>



<p>Argentine coach Lionel Scaloni has announced the 27-member squad for these two matches today. Giovanni Simeone got the call after 5 years. The 27-year-old striker is the son of Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone. After 33 years, Napoli won the Italian Serie &#8216;A&#8217;. Simeone contributed a lot to the Naples team to win the league title. His great performance did not go unnoticed by Scaloni.</p>



<p>In addition, Leonardo Balerdi, the defender of Olympique Marseille, returned to the team after 4 years. And the new face is Dutch club PSV Eindhoven goalkeeper Waltar Benitez.</p>



<p>However, the two World Cup winning forwards Paulo Dybala and Lautaro Martinez were not kept in the team. Dybala recently suffered an ankle injury. Martinez also has an ankle injury. However, he will undergo treatment after playing the Champions League final for Inter Milan. They have not been considered for the national team until they fully recover before the next club season.</p>
