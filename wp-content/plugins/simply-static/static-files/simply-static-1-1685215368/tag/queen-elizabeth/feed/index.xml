<p>Queen Elizabeth II visited the United States in 1983. There were threats that he might be assassinated. This is known from the recently released documents of the United States Central Bureau of Investigation (FBI).</p>



<p>Under the Right to Information Act, US media organizations requested information about Queen Elizabeth II&#8217;s visit to the United States. Following their request, 102 pages of documents about Rani were released on the FBI&#8217;s website &#8216;Vault&#8217; last Monday.</p>



<p>The Irish Republican Army (IRA) threatened to kill the Queen, according to a document. The FBI, which was in charge of the Queen&#8217;s security on that trip, was very concerned about this. The threat to kill Queen was made by a San Francisco police officer. He then reported the matter to FBI agents.</p>



<p>The police officer, who frequented an Irish pub, told FBI agents that a man he had seen at the Irish pub had called him and said he wanted revenge for his daughter&#8217;s murder. He claimed that his daughter was killed by rubber bullets in Northern Ireland.</p>



<p>The death threat was made on February 4, 1983, about a month before Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip visited California.</p>



<p>According to the document, the person who threatened to kill wanted to harm the queen by any means. He said he would try to assassinate the Queen when her royal yacht Britannia passes under the Golden Gate Bridge, drop a heavy object from the bridge, or when she visits Yosemite National Park.</p>



<p>Upon learning of this threat, the Secret Service planned to &#8216;close the walkways over the Golden Gate Bridge as the yacht approached&#8217;. However, the document does not clearly mention what action was taken in Yosemite National Park. But the Queen visited the park.</p>



<p>The FBI has not released any details on whether anyone was arrested in the incident.</p>



<p>During Queen Elizabeth II&#8217;s several state visits to the United States, including this one in 1983, tensions in Northern Ireland were known as the &#8216;Troubles in Northern Ireland&#8217;.</p>



<p>Queen Elizabeth II previously visited New York City in 1976 to attend the 200th anniversary of the United States&#8217; independence.</p>



<p>Documents reveal how a pilot was instructed to fly a small plane over Battery Park with the words &#8216;Exit England, Ireland&#8217;.</p>



<p>According to the documents, the FBI was then on high alert for Rani&#8217;s assassination threats. Lord Mountbatten, a relative of the Queen, was killed in a bomb attack off the coast of County Sligo in the Republic of Ireland in 1979. The bombing was carried out by the Irish Republican Army.</p>



<p>In 1989, the FBI released internal documents, or memos, about Queen&#8217;s personal visit to Kentucky. It read, &#8216;The Irish Republican Army is still a threat to the British monarchy&#8217;.</p>



<p>The document also said, &#8216;Boston and New York authorities have been asked to be on alert for any IRA threats against the Queen. Louisville, Kentucky will also be called immediately.&#8217;</p>



<p>The late Queen Elizabeth II had a keen interest in horse racing. The Queen had her own racehorse. He visited Kentucky several times during his lifetime to enjoy horse racing.</p>



<p>In 1991, the Queen was scheduled to watch a Baltimore Orioles baseball game with then-US President George H. Bush on a state visit.</p>



<p>The FBI warned the Secret Service that &#8216;Irish groups&#8217; were planning demonstrations at the stadium. For this &#8216;an Irish group bought the bulk of the grandstand tickets&#8217;.</p>



<p>The FBI told NBC News there may be &#8220;additional documents&#8221; beyond those released this week. However, the date of when they can be published has not been fixed.</p>
