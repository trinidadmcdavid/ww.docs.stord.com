After all the controversies and criticisms, the opening phase is starting on Sunday morning. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will inaugurate. A new controversy has also arisen over keeping &#8216;Sengal&#8217;, a gold bar studded with ancient jewels, in the new building.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prime Minister launched the Rs 24,000-crore &#8216;Central Vista&#8217; project amidst India&#8217;s ailing economy amid the Covid situation. The new parliament building is a part of that project. At that time, the necessity of this project was discussed in various quarters. There was also a public interest litigation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the new parliament building was built by overcoming all obstacles and ignoring all objections. Its opening phase is going to start from 7:30 am on Sunday. It will end at two o&#8217;clock.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the center of the debate in the early stages was the necessity of the decision. It takes a new form when it comes to the opening phase. The president of the country is the guardian of the parliament. The session of Parliament started and ended at his call. The budget session of Parliament starts every year with the President&#8217;s address to the joint session of the members of the two chambers. Why is the head of government inaugurating a new building leaving that guardian behind, the country is in turmoil.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the majority of opposition parties deciding to boycott the event, the government remained firm. According to the calendar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will arrive at the new building at 7:30 am to start the program on the 14th day of Jaishtha Ashtami Tithi. At 7:30 p.m., worship-archana and yajna ceremony started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The debate about why Hinduism is the seat of democracy in secular India, which arose during the foundation stone laying ceremony of the new Parliament building, may also arise this time. But the question of the service was unsettled by the government, it will surely be unsettled this time too.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Controversy has arisen over &#8216;Sengal&#8217;, an ancient gem-studded gold bar. It was the custom of the Chola dynasty that ruled the Deccan in ancient times to hand over Sengal to the new king. The exchange of tiles was symbolic of the transfer of power. Union Home Minister Amit Shah claims that Lord Mountbatten, the last viceroy of British India, handed over the golden rod to Sengal Jawaharlal Nehru on the eve of independence. That was done on the advice of the last Governor General Chakraborty Rajagopalachari. Accordingly, a brick is made. Mountbatten gave that brick to Nehru. Nehru kept the brick in a collection in Allahabad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, the Modi government recovered it and brought it to Delhi. On Sunday, Sengal will have his place in the Lok Sabha of the new Parliament building. By giving this information, Amit Shah taunted the Congress and said that this is the proof of how indifferent the Congress is to the ancient traditions of the country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This demand of the government has also been debated. Congress has officially said that Sengal&#8217;s story is completely fabricated. There is no record anywhere that Mountbatten transferred power through a single transfer. On that night of August 14, there was no such official event. It is not even mentioned in any official description. There is no picture anywhere of Mountbatten handing Nehru the single. The whole claim is fictitious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to historians, a monk from a monastery in Tamil Nadu visited Nehru&#8217;s residence and handed it over to him. Nehru accepted it. That information is there. That brick was kept in the Allahabad Museum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chakraborty Rajagopalachari&#8217;s grandson and biographer Rajmohan Gandhi wrote in an article about the controversy that he was unaware of the exchange of tiles as part of the transfer of power ceremony. The government should make public all official documents on the matter when the government demands it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This controversy has also become big around the inauguration of the new parliament building. At the same time, politics is also raising its head. The opposition alleges that the BJP is trying to use Sengal to gain control of the land under its feet in Tamil Nadu.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Prime Minister will come to the Lok Sabha at 8:30 am after the puja on Sunday. There the gold bar will be placed near the Speaker&#8217;s seat. Then there will be a prayer meeting in the lobby. Modi will return after the prayer meeting at 9:30 am. Will come again at 12 noon. Another event will begin with the national anthem. Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha Harivansh will read the speech and message of the Guardian President Draupadi Murmu and Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar. Mallikarjun Kharg, Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha Congress, was scheduled to deliver the address. But the Congress is boycotting the event. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla will deliver the address. The Prime Minister will release a commemorative coin of Rs 75 on the occasion of 75 years of Independence. The program will end at 2 pm with Modi&#8217;s speech.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Controversy will still remain in GEE. The new parliament building has 888 seats in the Lok Sabha and 350 in the Rajya Sabha. At present there are 543 members in the Lok Sabha and 250 in the Rajya Sabha. The increase in population will also increase the number of representatives from state to state in the future. The debate has already started.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because birth control is successful in all states of South India. The number of representatives of North India will be much higher than those of those states. Because population control in the Hindi belt is not as successful as in the south. As a result, the dominant party in the North would rule the country without the support of the Deccan. Politicians of Deccan have become involved in this.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Controversy is not leaving behind India&#8217;s new parliament building.
