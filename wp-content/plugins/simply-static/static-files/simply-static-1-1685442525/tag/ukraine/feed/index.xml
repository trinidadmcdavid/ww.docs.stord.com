<p>Ukraine has denied involvement in the drone attack in the Russian capital, Moscow. The attack happened early Tuesday morning. However, no one was injured.</p>



<p>Mykhailo Podoliak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, denied the drone strike in Moscow in response to a question on a television program. He said, &#8216;We are not involved in any way.&#8217;</p>



<p>&#8220;This morning, a drone strike at sunrise caused minor damage to some buildings,&#8221; Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said shortly after the drone strike. City emergency services responded to the scene â€¦ No one was reported to be seriously injured.&#8217;</p>



<p>Moscow is more than 1000 kilometers away from Ukraine. Drone strikes in Moscow have been rare since the start of the Russia-Ukraine war. However, other parts of Russia are subject to almost regular drone strikes.</p>



<p>Pictures posted on social media showed smoke billowing from the site of the impact. The windows of some buildings were broken.</p>
