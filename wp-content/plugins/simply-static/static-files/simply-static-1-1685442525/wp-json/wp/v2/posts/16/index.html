Russia has avoided the danger that would have affected the Russian economy if the 325 tons of gold produced per year were all within the country&#8217;s borders. Again, the United Arab Emirates, China and Turkey have benefited from it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the information of the Excise Department of Russia, about 1,000 gold shipments from that country went to the United Arab Emirates after the ban of Western countries came down. During this period Russian gold imports there increased rather than decreased.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, the year before the ban was imposed, 74.3 tonnes of gold went from Russia to the UAE. In 2022, gold imported there increased by 1.3 tons to 75.7 tons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The United Arab Emirates is now the biggest buyer of Russia&#8217;s gold, which has been under pressure from sanctions after its attack on Ukraine. It is followed by China and T\u00fcrkiye. From February 24, 2022 to March 3, 2023, Russia exported 20 tons of gold to these two countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to data recorded by Russia&#8217;s customs department, 99.8 percent of the world&#8217;s largest country&#8217;s gold exports since the ban began have gone to the United Arab Emirates, China and Turkey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the ban, most Russian gold went to the UK. But after Western countries imposed sanctions, many of the world&#8217;s multinational banks, metal refining and buying and selling companies turned their backs on Moscow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On March 7, 2022, the London Bullion Market Association also completely stopped importing gold bars from Russia. By August 2022, the European Union, Switzerland, the United States, Canada, and Japan also announced the severance of all trade relations with Russia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Russia&#8217;s strategy<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Immediately after the sanctions began, Russia decided on a survival strategy. Russian President Vladimir Putin will not stop the attack. So there will be a ban. In this situation, Russian producers started trying to export gold at a higher rate than before with the countries that did not ban it. They offer buyers an opportunity to purchase at 1 percent less than the actual market price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been many attempts to neutralize this Russian strategy but it has not worked. The US directly threatened T\u00fcrkiye and the United Arab Emirates. Washington said the two countries would lose access to markets in the G-7 region if they maintained trade relations with any country or entity that has US sanctions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development&#8217;s gold expert Louis Marechal thinks that the United States had a big worry at the time, that the gold going from Russia to the United Arab Emirates, China and Turkey could be melted down and sent to Biden&#8217;s country in a new form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the Gold Bullion Committee of the United Arab Emirates said that they always keep a watchful eye to ensure that not even a single ounce of illegal gold is imported or exported. In a statement, they also said that the United Arab Emirates will continue doing business with international partners in accordance with the rules declared by the United Nations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not the case that Russia is able to sell all the gold it produces even if it can continue to export to the three countries. Russia produced a total of 325 tons of gold in 2022. From there, only 116.3 tonnes have been exported so far.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Russia was in danger of producing gold.
